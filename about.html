                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our hospital has been a cornerstone of the community for
                        over 50 years. Founded in 1970 by Dr. John Smith, our
                        facility started as a small clinic and has since grown
                        into a leading medical institution serving thousands of
                        patients annually. Over the years, we have continuously
                        expanded our services and facilities to meet the
                        evolving healthcare needs of our community.
